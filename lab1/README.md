This is my documentation of the app created. This requires the software of expo. Expo is a open-source platform for creating apps, and that is one of the goals for this class. We can use our phone to get the app to work. I wrote the simplest possible version for the app by writing "Hello expo"
The purpose of App.js is the creation of the application. We can modify the text and style.
package.json stores relevant metadata in the project such as npm which helped us transfer the program to the app on our phone.
node_modules help build the metadata used package.json
.gitignore is a text file that that tells git what folders not to use.
